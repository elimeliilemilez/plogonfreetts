; i have vague ideas what i am doing, here's a series of comments for what i think i need to write in what order

; defining the keybind used to trigger the script (should be only 1 key for convenience probably)

; focusing the ffxiv.exe window (reduncancy in case ive tabbed out and covered the dialogue box with another window...)

; pushing the keys Ctrl Shift Win + C to run my OCR (PowerToys Text Extractor)

; moving cursor to xy and leftclick-drag to xy for copying dialogue box (use ahk window spy to identify coordinates)

; focusing the Grid3.exe window (my AAC software that has great speech synthesis) + pushing key F23 to clear old text (grid-command)

; pushing the keys Ctrl + V to paste into Grid 3 + pushing key F24 to speak (grid-command)

; waiting x seconds before returning focus to ffxiv and pushing key B (Confirm) to move to the next dialogue

; i dont know if i want the script to auto-repeat or not but i think maybe not
